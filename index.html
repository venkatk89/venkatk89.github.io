					Venkatesh is an autodidactic data scientist and a musician who is not comfortable with addressing
					himself in the third person.
				</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, Hello!
				</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solving problems have always excited me. My propensity to solve complex problems uprooted me from my
					hometown and planted me
					in the Indian Institute of Technology Madras to pursue an undergraduate degree in Engineering
					Physics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amazing things start from simple means. When tasked to calculate the value of Plank's constant from
					a photoelectric effect experimental setup,
					I first came upon the term linear regression. I was intrigued and delved deeper into the field of
					statistical computing.
					The interest was unabating, and I started to pursue data science as a career.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a data scientist, I've collaborated with companies of varying profiles, ranging from fortune
					500's to small businesses.
					I've successfully applied my skills to solve some central problems in the areas of e-commerce,
					fintech, logistics, and marketing
					to gain domain expertise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Asking questions is one of the best ways to grow. It was a question of the impact that helped me
					realize that
					some problems are more crucial. This realization encouraged me to embark on a journey:<br>
					<i>To solve problems whose solutions have a positive impact on this world.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					I started to learn and dig deeper into bioinformatics.
					I aspire to learn state-of-the-art and be on the cutting-edge of this field.

				<p>
					I know this page is a bit long for a bio. So thanks for taking an interest in reading my story.
					Wait a minute. I believe that I said something about music. So here it is.
				</p>
				<p>
					I play the Harmonium, Melodica, and MIDI keyboards and am motivated to work with MPE supported
					instruments.
					I am an avid listener of Tamil filmi music and have recently developed a taste in western and Indian
					classical music.
					I love to improvise on the works of great composers while desperately trying to maintain the
					intricacies.

					As an inquisitive person, I am always up for learning something new. And when I encounter enigmatic
					concepts, I've used writing to clear the haze in my brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the doubts still prevailed, it was the technical blogs on the internet that came to my rescue. I
					am grateful for the authors of those blogs. </p>
				<blockquote>
					"Do something for yourself. Do it for your satisfaction. Do it so that it helps you. <br>
					Then give it all away..." <br> - Probably someone wise
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					When I took a year off after I quit my job, besides other things, I decided to give something back
					to
					the data science community.
					So, I started to write engaging articles in various fields of data science for beginners.
					A few of these articles are listed below.
